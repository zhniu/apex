== APEX Configuration

An APEX engine can be configured to use various combinations of
	event input handlers,
	event output handlers,
	event protocols,
	context handlers, and
	logic executors.
The system is build using a plugin architecture.
Each configuration option is realized by a plugin, which can be loaded and configured when the engine is started.
New plugins can be added to the system at any time, though to benefit from a new plugin an engine will need to be restarted.
