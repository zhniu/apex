== Flexible Clustering

APEX can be clustered in various ways.
The following figure shows a few of these clustering options.
Cluster, engine and (policy) executors are named UPec (universal policy cluster), UPe (universal policy engine, APEX engine) and UPx (universal policy executor, the APEX internal state machine executor).
