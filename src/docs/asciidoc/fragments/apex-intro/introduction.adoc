== Introduction to APEX

APEX stand for Adaptive Policy EXecution.
It is a lightweight engine for execution of policies.
APEX allows you to specify logic as a policy, logic that you can adapt on the fly as your system executes.
The APEX policies you design can be really simple, with a single snippet of logic, or can be very complex, with many states and tasks.
APEX policies can even be designed to self-adapt at execution time, the choice is yours!

The Adaptive Policy Engine in APEX runs your policies.
These policies are triggered by incoming events.
The logic of the policies executes and produces a response event.
The __Incoming Context__ on the incoming event and the __Outgoing Context__ on the outgoing event are simply the fields and attributes of the event.
You design the policies that APEX executes and the trigger and action events that your policies accept and produce.
Events are fed in and sent out as JSON or XML events over Kafka, a Websocket, a file or named pipe, or even standard input.
If you run APEX as a library in your application, you can even feed and receive events over a Java API.

.APEX States and Context

You design your policy as a chain of states, with each state being fed by the state before.
The simplest policy can have just one state.
We provide specific support for the four-state link:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303564082_Apex_An_Engine_for_Dynamic_Adaptive_Policy_Execution[MEDA (Match Establish Decide Act)] policy state model and the three-state link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_condition_action[ECA (Event Condition Action)] policy state model.
APEX is fully distributed.
You can decide how many APEX engine instances to run for your application and on which real or virtual hosts to run them.

In APEX, you also have control of the __Context__ used by your policies.
Context is simply the state information and data used by your policies.
You define what context your policies use and what the scope of that context is.
__Policy Context__ is private to a particular policy and is accessible only to whatever APEX engines are running that particular policy.
__Global Context__ is available to all policies.
__External Context__ is read-only context such as weather or topology information that is provided by other systems.
APEX keeps context coordinated across all the the instances running a particular policy.
If a policy running in an APEX engine changes the value of a piece of context, that value is is available to all other APEX engines that use that piece of context.
APEX takes care of distribution, locking, writing of context to persistent storage, and monitoring of context.

.The APEX Eco-System

The APEX engine (AP-EN) is available as a Java library for inclusion in your application, as a microservice running in a Docker container, or as a stand-alone service available for integration into your system.
APEX also includes a policy editor (AP-AUTH) that allows you to design your policies and a web-based policy management console you use to deploy policies and to keep track of the state of policies and context in policies.
Context handling (AP-CTX) is integrated into the APEX engine and policy deployment (AP-DEP) is provided as a servlet running under a web framework such as link:http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat].
