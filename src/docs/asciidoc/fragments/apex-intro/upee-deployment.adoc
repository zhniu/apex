== Flexible Deployment

APEX can be deployed in various ways.
The following figure shows a few of these deployment options.
Engine and (policy) executors are named UPe (universal policy engine, APEX engine) and UPx (universal policy executor, the APEX internal state machine executor).

. As a service (PolaS)
	* One or more UPe with service i/f
	* One or more Upec/UPec with service i/f
	* One or more Upec/UPec with service i/f
. In a control loop
	* UPe as decision making part
	* UPec as decision making part
. On cloud compute nodes
	* Nodes with only UPe or Upec
	* Nodes with any combination of UPe, UPec
. A cloud example
	* Left: 2 UPec managing several UPe on different cloud nodes
	* Right: 2 large UPec with different UPe/UPec deployments
