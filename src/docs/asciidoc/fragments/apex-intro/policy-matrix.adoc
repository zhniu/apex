== APEX Policy Matrix

APEX offers a lot of flexibility for defining, deploying, and executing policies.
Based on a theoretic model, it supports virtually any policy model and allows to translate legacy policies into the APEX execution format.
However, the most important aspect for using APEX is to decide what policy is needed, what underlying policy concepts should be used, and how the decision logic should be realized.
Once these aspects are decided, APEX can be used to execute the policies.
If the policy evolves, say from a simple decision table to a fully adaptable policy, only the policy definition requires change.
APEX supports all of that.

The figure below shows a (non-exhaustive) matrix, which will help to decide what policy is required to solve your problem.
Read the matrix from left to right choosing one cell in each column.

The policy can support one of a number of stimuli with an associated purpose/model of the policy, for instance:

* Configuration, i.e. what should happen.
	An example is an event that states an intended network configuration and the policy should provide the detailed actions for it.
	The policy can be realized for instance as an obligation policy, a promise or an intent.
* Report, i.e. something did happen.
	An example is an event about an error or fault and the policy needs to repair that problem.
	The policy would usually be an obligation, utility function, or goal policy.
* Monitoring, i.e. something does happen.
	An example is a notification about certain network conditions, to which the policy might (or might not) react.
	The policy will mitigate the monitored events or permit (deny) related actions as an obligation or authorization.
* Analysis, i.e. why did something happen.
	An example is an analytic component sends insights of a situation requiring a policy to act on it.
	The policy can solve the problem, escalate it, or delegate it as a refrain or delegation policy.
* Prediction, i.e. what will happen next.
	An example are events that a policy uses to predict a future network condition.
	The policy can prevent or enforce the prediction as an adaptive policy, a utility function, or a goal.
* Feedback, i.e. why did something happen or not happen.
	Similar to analysis, but here the feedback will be in the input event and the policy needs to something with that information.
	Feedback can be related to history or experience, for instance a previous policy execution.
	The policy needs to be context-aware or be a meta-policy.

Once the purpose of the policy is decided, the next step is to look into what context information the policy will require to do its job.
This can range from very simple to a lot of different information, for instance:

* No context, nothing but a trigger event, e.g. a string or a number, is required
* Event context, the incoming event provides all information (more than a string or number) for the policy
* Policy context (read only), the policy has access to additional information related to its class but cannot change/alter them
* Policy context (read and write), the policy has access to additional information related to its class and can alter this information (for instance to record historic information)
* Global context (read only), the policy has access to additional information of any kind but cannot change/alter them
* Global context (read and write), the policy the policy has access to additional information of any kind and can alter this information (for instance to record historic information)

The next step is to decide how the policy should do its job, i.e. what flavor it has, how many states are needed, and how many tasks.
There are many possible combinations, for instance:

* Simple / God: a simple policy with 1 state and 1 task, which is doing everything for the decision-making.
	This is the ideal policy for simple situation, e.g. deciding on configuration parameters or simple access control.
* Simple sequence: a simple policy with a number of states each having a single task.
	This is a very good policy for simple decision-making with different steps.
	For instance, a classic action policy (ECA) would have 3 states (E, C, and A) with some logic (1 task) in each state.
* Simple selective: a policy with 1 state but more than one task.
	Here, the appropriate task (and it's logic) will be selected at execution time.
	This policy is very good for dealing with similar (or the same) situation in different contexts.
	For instance, the tasks can be related to available external software, or to current work load on the compute node, or to time of day.
* Selective: any number of states having any number of tasks (usually more than 1 task).
	This is a combination of the two policies above, for instance an ECA policy with more than one task in E, C, and A.
* Classic directed: a policy with more than one state, each having one task, but a non-sequential execution.
	This means that the sequence of the states is not pre-defined in the policy (as would be for all cases above) but calculated at runtime.
	This can be good to realize decision trees based on contextual information.
* Super Adaptive: using the full potential of the APEX policy model, states and tasks and state execution are fully flexible and calculated at runtime (per policy execution).
	This policy is very close to a general programming system (with only a few limitations), but can solve very hard problems.

The final step is to select a response that the policy creates.
Possible responses have been discussed in the literature for a very long time.
A few examples are:

* Obligation (deontic for what should happen)
* Authorization (e.g. for rule-based or other access control or security systems)
* Intent (instead of providing detailed actions the response is an intent statement and a further system processes that)
* Delegation (hand the problem over to someone else, possibly with some information or instructions)
* Fail / Error (the policy has encountered a problem, and reports it)
* Feedback (why did the policy make a certain decision)
