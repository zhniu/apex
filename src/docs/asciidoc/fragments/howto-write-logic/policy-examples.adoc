== My First Policy

A good starting point is the `My First Policy` example.
It describes a sales problem, to which policy can be applied.
The example details the policy background, shows how to use the REST Editor to create a policy, and provides details for running the policies.

== VPN SLA

The domain Policy-controlled Video Streaming (PCVS) contains a policy for controlling video streams with different strategies.
It also provides details for installing an actual testbed with off-the-shelve software (Mininet, Floodlight, Kafka, Zookeeper).
The policy model here demonstrates virtually all APEX features: local context and policies controlling it, task selection logic and multiple tasks in a single state, AVRO schemas for context, AVOR schemas for events (trigger and local), and a CLI editor specification of the policy.

== Decision Maker

The domain Decision Maker shows a very simple policy for decisions.
Interesting here is that the it creates a Docker image to run the policy and that it uses the APEX REST applications to update the policy on the-fly.
It also has local context to remember past decisions, and shows how to use that to no make the same decision twice in a row.
