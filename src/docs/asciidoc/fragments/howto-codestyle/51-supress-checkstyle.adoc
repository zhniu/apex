== Supress Checkstyle (partially)

Sometimes Checkstyle checks identify code that does not comply with Checkstyle rules.
In limited cases Checkstyle rules can be suppressed, for example where it is impossible to design the code in a way that complies with Checkstyle or where the Checkstyle rule is impossible to apply.
Checkstyle rules are suppressed as is explained in this link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4023185/how-to-disable-a-particular-checkstyle-rule-for-a-particular-line-of-code[Stackoverflow post].

The example below illustrates how to suppress a Checkstyle rule that specifies all methods must have seven parameters or less.

[source%nowrap,java,numbered]
----
// CHECKSTYLE:OFF: checkstyle:ParameterNumber
public myMethod(final int par1, final int par2, final int par3, final int par4,
  final int par5, final int par6, final int par7, final int par8) {
}
// CHECKSTYLE:ON: checkstyle:ParameterNumber
