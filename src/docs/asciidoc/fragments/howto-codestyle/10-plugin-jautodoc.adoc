== Eclipse Plugin: JAutodoc

This plugin is a helper plugin for writing Javadoc.
It will automatically create standard headers on files, create package-info.java files and will put in remarkably good stub Javadoc comments in your code, using class names and method names as hints.

Available from the Eclipse Marketplace.
In Eclipse Help->Eclipse Marketplace... and type `JAutodoc`.
Select JAutodoc when the search returns and install it.

You must configure JAutoDoc in order to get the most out of it.
Ideally JAutoDoc should be configured with templates that cooperate with the inbuilt Eclipse Code Formatter for best results.
