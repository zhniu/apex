== Demo with VPN Policy Model

We assume that you have an APEX installation using the full package, i.e. APEX with all examples, of version `0.5.6` or higher.
We will use the VPN policy from the APEX examples here.

Now, have the following ready to start the demo:

- 3 terminals on the host where APEX is running (we need 1 for APEX and 1 for each client)
- the events in the file `$APEX_HOME/examples/events/VPN/SetupEvents.json` open in an editor (we need to send those events to APEX)
- the events in the file `$APEX_HOME/examples/events/VPN/Link09Events.json` open in an editor (we need to send those events to APEX)
