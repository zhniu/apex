h| Venue
| 1st IEEE 5G Summit, Princeton, May 25, 2015

h| Abstract
| This presentation outlines the problems with existing policy based management systems and why we now need adaptive policy based management systems enabling networks to be self-governed. The talk focuses on the integration of key technologies shaping the future of the ENM Automation Framework, including control theory, predictive analytics, policy-based management context aware computing, knowledge engineering and semantics, modelling of adaptive behavior.
