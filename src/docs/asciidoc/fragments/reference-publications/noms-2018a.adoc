h| Abstract
| Since the 1970’s it has been acknowledged that a
complex system can be broken into (a) its invariant functional
parts (mechanism), and (b) the externalized choices for how the
system should behave (policy). Policy-based management’s main
objective is to separate and externalize the decisions required by a
system from the mechanisms provided by the system, and provide
a way to define and evaluate these decisions. A few decades later,
we have today a plethora of different policy models and even more
policy languages – plus tooling – offering policy-based solutions
for virtually any use case and scenario. However, policy-based
management as a standalone domain has never been evaluated
in terms of which parts are variant / invariant, i.e. which parts
of policy-based management can be domain-, model-, language-,
usecase-independent. In this paper, we introduce and define a
formal universal policy model that does exactly that. The result
is a model that can be used to design, implement, and deploy
immutable policy infrastructure (engine and executor) being able
to execute (virtually) any policy model.
