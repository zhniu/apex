h| Abstract
| 5G networks will be the first real converged networks
supporting a plethora of different services, each with their
own requirements. A static best-effort approach is no longer
sufficient. Extreme flexibility and dynamicity is required, yet costs
must be drastically reduced. The only way that these conflicting
goals can be achieved is with vastly increased automation in the
provision and operation of our future 5G networks. In this paper
we briefly discuss the facilitators, goals and challenges for 5G
networks. We identify some of the places where automation is not
just helpful, but is in fact required for 5G to become a reality.
We go on to present a conceptual approach for modeling and
achieving autonomic operations and management in 5G networks
positioning modern policy-based management as a key enabler
for autonomic 5G network management.
