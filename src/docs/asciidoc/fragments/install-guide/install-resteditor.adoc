== Installing the REST Editor

APEX comes with a RESR Editor application realized as a servlett.
This requires a _full_ installation of APEX.
This requires a web server that can execute `war` web archives.
We recommend to use link:https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat], however other web servers can be used as well.

Install Apache Tomcat including the `Manager App`, see link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Configuring_Manager_Application_Access[V9.0 Docs] for details.
Start the Tomcat service, or make sure that Tomcat is running.
Locate the APEX monitoring application in your local APEX installation.

[source%nowrap,sh,numbered,subs="attributes+"]
----
$APEX_HOME/war/apex-services.client-editor-{release-version}.war
----

[source%nowrap,bat,numbered,subs="attributes+"]
----
%APEX_HOME%\war\apex-services.client-editor-{release-version}.war
----

There are multiple ways to install the APEX monitoring application:

- copy the `.war` file into the Tomcat `webapps` folder
- use the Tomcat `Manager App` to deploy via the web interface
- deploy using a REST call to Tomcat

For details on how to install `war` files please consult the link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/index.html[Tomcat Documentation] or the link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html[Manager App HOW-TO].
Once you installed the APEX monitoring application (and wait for sufficient time for Tomcat to finalize the installation), open the `Manager App` in Tomcat.
You should see the APEX REST Editor application being installed and running.

In case of errors, examine the log files in the Tomcat log directory.
In a conventional install, those log files are in the logs directory where Tomcat is installed.

Once the APEX REST Editor is installed, open a browser (or a new tab) and use the following URL to connect to the APEX monitoring application.
Change the values for the Tomcat port (`10080` in the example), the APEX REST EDITOR version (`{release-version}` in the example), and the APEX management port (`12345` in the example, taken from the example configuration) to your local settings.
If your browser is not opened on the same host as the APEX engine runs, change `localhost` to the host name with the APEX engine.

[source%nowrap,url,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://localhost:10080/apex%2Dauth.rest%2D{release-version}/
----

The browser will now show the APEX REST Editor.

Terminate the browser now (or the tab with the application).
Finally, if you do not want to use Tomcat for any other applications, terminate the Tomcat server as well.
