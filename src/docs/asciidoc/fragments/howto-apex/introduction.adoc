== Introduction to APEX Engine and Applications
The core of APEX is the APEX Engine, also known as the APEX Policy Engine.
Beside this engine, an APEX system comes with a few applications intended to help with policy authoring, deployment, and execution.

The engine itself and most applications are started from the command line with command line arguments.
This is called a Command Line Interface (CLI).
Some applications require an installation on a webserver, as for instance the REST Editor.
Those applications can be accessed via a web browser.

Starting with APEX version 0.5.6, we also provide plugins for Eclipse realizing a policy development environment.
Those plugins support the main APEX policy language.
Other, higher-level, policy languages will be added in future versions along with their Eclipse plugins.
Furthermore, we are planning to provide a backend supporting the Language Server Protocol (LSP).
This backend, run as a server, will allow to join any editor or IDE that is LSP-enabled to benefit from the APEX policy languages.

Last not least, one can use the available APEX APIs and applications to develop other applications as required.
This includes policy languages (and associated parsers and compilers / interpreters), GUIs to access APEX or to define policies, clients to connect to APEX, etc.
Separate documentation will be available in APEX releases addressing this type of applications.

For this documentation, we assume an installation of APEX as a full system (i.e. not minimal) of version 0.5.6 or higher.

== CLI on Unix, Windows, and Cygwin
A note on APEX CLI applications: all applications and the engine itself have been deployed and tested on different operating systems: Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, Mac OSX, Windows, Cygwin.
Each operating system comes with its own way of configuring and executing Java.
The main items here are:

- For UNIX systems (RHL, Ubuntu, Debian, Mac OSX), the provided bash scripts work as expected
  with absolute paths (e.g. `/opt/ericsson/apex/apex-{release-version}/examples`),
  indirect and linked paths (e.g. `../apex/apex`),
  and path substitutions using environment settings (e.g. `$APEX_HOME/bin/`)
- For Windows systems, the provided batch files (`.bat`) work as expected with 
  with absolute paths (e.g. `C:\apex\apex-{release-version}\examples`),
  and path substitutions using environment settings (e.g. `%APEX_HOME%\bin\`)
- For Cygwin system we assume a standard Cygwin installation with standard tools (mainly bash) using a Windows Java installation.
  This means that the bash scripts can be used as in UNIX, however any argument pointing to files and directories need to use either a DOS path (e.g. `C:\apex\apex-{release-version}\examples\config\...`)
  or the command `cygpath` with a mixed option.
  The reason for that is: Cygwin executes Java using UNIX paths but then runs Java as a DOS/WINDOWS process, which requires DOS paths for file access.
