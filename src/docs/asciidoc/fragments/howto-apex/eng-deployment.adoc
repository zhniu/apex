== The APEX Deployment Client
The standard way to use the APEX Deployment Client is via an installation of the __war__ file on a webserver.
However, the Deployment Client can also be started via command line.
This will start a Grizzly webserver with the __war__ deployed.
Access to the Deployment Client is then via the provided URL 

On UNIX and Cygwin systems use:

- `apexApps.sh eng-deployment` - simply starts the webserver with the Deployment Client

On Windows systems use:

- `apexApps.bat eng-deployment` - simply starts the webserver with the Deployment Client


The option `-h` provides a help screen with all command line arguments.

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
usage: com.ericsson.apex.services.client.deployment.rest.ApexDeploymentRestMain [options...]
-h,--help                         outputs the usage of this command
-p,--port <PORT>                  port to use for the Apex Services REST calls
-t,--time-to-live <TIME_TO_LIVE>  the amount of time in seconds that the server will run for before terminating
----

If the Deployment Client is started without any arguments the final messages will look similar to this:

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
INFO: [HttpServer] Started.
Apex Services REST endpoint (ApexDeploymentRestMain: Config=[ApexDeploymentRestParameters: URI=http://localhost:18989/apexservices/, TTL=-1sec], State=RUNNING) started at http://localhost:18989/apexservices/
----

The last line states the URL on which the Deployment Client can be accessed.
The example above stated `http://localhost:18989/apexservices`.
In a web browser use the URL `http://localhost:18989`.
