== The APEX Application Launcher
The standard applications (Engine, CLI Editor, REST Editor) come with dedicated start scripts.
For all other APEX applications, we provide an application launcher.

On UNIX and Cygwin systems use:

- apexApps.sh` - simply starts the application launcher

On Windows systems use:

- `apexApps.bat` - simply starts the application launcher


Summary of alternatives to start the APEX application launcher:

The option `-h` provides a help screen with all launcher command line arguments.

apexApps.sh - runs APEX applications

       Usage:  apexApps.sh [options] | [<application> [<application options>]]

       Options
         -d <app>    - describes an application
         -l          - lists all applications supported by this script
         -h          - this help screen
----

Using `-l` lists all known application the launcher can start.

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
apexApps.sh: supported applications:
 --> ws-echo engine eng-monitoring full-client eng-deployment tpl-event-json model-2-cli rest-editor cli-editor ws-console
----

Using the `-d <name>` option describes the named application, for instance for the `ws-console`:

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
apexApps.sh: application 'ws-console'
 --> a simple console sending events to APEX, connect to APEX consumer port
----

Launching an application is done by calling the script with only the application name and any CLI arguments for the application.
For instance, starting the `ws-echo` application with port `8888`:
[source%nowrap,sh]
----
apexApps.sh ws-echo -p 8888
----
