== The APEX REST Editor
The standard way to use the APEX REST Editor is via an installation of the __war__ file on a webserver.
However, the REST editor can also be started via command line.
This will start a Grizzly webserver with the __war__ deployed.
Access to the REST Editor is then via the provided URL 

On UNIX and Cygwin systems use:

- `apexRESTEditor.sh` - simply starts the webserver with the REST editor
- `apexApps.sh rest-editor` - simply starts the webserver with the REST editor

On Windows systems use:

- `apexRESTEditor.bat` - simply starts the webserver with the REST editor
- `apexApps.bat rest-editor` - simply starts the webserver with the REST editor

The option `-h` provides a help screen with all command line arguments.

[source%nowrap,sh]

-h,--help                        outputs the usage of this command
-l,--listen <ADDRESS>            the IP address to listen on.  Default value is 0.0.0.0 to listen on all available
                                 addresses. Use value 'localhost' to restrict access to the local machine only.
-p,--port <PORT>                 port to use for the Apex RESTful editor REST calls.
-t,--time-to-live <TIME_TO_LIVE> the amount of time in seconds that the server will run for before terminating. Default
                                 value is -1 to run indefinitely.

If the REST Editor is started without any arguments the final messages will look similar to this:

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
INFO: [HttpServer] Started.
Apex Editor REST endpoint (ApexEditorMain: Config=[ApexEditorParameters: URI=http://0.0.0.0:18988/apex/, TTL=-1sec], State=RUNNING) started at http://0.0.0.0:18988/apex/
----

The last line states the URL on which the REST Editor can be accessed.
The example above stated `http://0.0.0.0:18988/apex/`.
In a web browser use the URL `http://localhost:18988` and the REST Editor will start.
