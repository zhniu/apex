== Application: Websocket Clients (Echo and Console)

**Status: Production**

The application launcher also provides a Websocket echo client and a Websocket console client.
The echo client connects to APEX and prints all events it receives from APEX.
The console client connects to APEX, reads input from the command line, and sends this input as events to APEX.

The arguments are the same for both applications:

- `-p` defines the Websocket port to connect to (defaults to `8887`)
- `-s` defines the host on which a Websocket server is running (defaults to `localhost`)

A discussion on how to use these two applications to build an APEX system is detailed HowTo-Websockets.
