== Introduction to building APEX

APEX is written 100% in Java and uses link:https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] as the build system.
The requirements for building APEX are:

- An installed Java development kit for Java version 8 or higher
  ** To install a Java SDK please follow these guidelines link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html[Oracle Java 8 SDK].
- Maven 3
  ** To get Maven 3 running please follow the guidelines for link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Download] and link:https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Install], and link:https://maven.apache.org/run.html[Run] Maven
- A clone of the APEX source repositories

To get a clone of the APEX source repositories, please see the APEX Installation Guide or the APEX User manual.

One all requirements are in place, APEX can be build.
There are several different artifacts one can create building APEX, most of them defined in their own __profile__.
APEX can also be build in a standard way with standard tests (`mvn clean install`) or without standard tests (`mvn clean install -DskipTests`).

The examples in this document assume that the APEX source repositories are cloned to:

- Unix, Cygwin: `/usr/local/src/apex`
- Windows: `C:\dev\apex`
- Cygwin: `/cygdrive/c/dev/apex`

[IMPORTANT]
.A Build needs Space
====
Building APEX requires approximately 2-3 GB of hard disc space, 1 GB for the actual build with full distribution and 1-2 GB for the downloaded dependencies
====

[IMPORTANT]
.A Build requires Internet (for first build to download all dependencies and plugins)
====
During the build, several (a lot) of Maven dependencies will be downloaded and stored in the configured local Maven repository.
The first standard build (and any first specific build) requires Internet access to download those dependencies.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Building RPM distributions
====
RPM images are only build if the `rpm` package is installed (Unix).
To install `rpm` run `sudo apt-get install rpm`, then build APEX.
