== Build the APEX Documentation

The APEX Maven build also includes stand-alone documentations, such as the HowTo documents, the Installation Guide, and the User Manual.
Use Maven to build the APEX Documentation.
The Maven options `-N` prevents Maven to go through all APEX modules, which is not necessary for the documentation.
The final documents will be in `target/generated-docs` (Windows: `target\generated-docs`).
The __HTML__ documents are in the `html/` folder, the __PDF__ documents are in the `pdf/` folder.
Once the documentation is build, copy the __HTML__ and __PDF__ documents to a folder of choice
