== Build APEX Site

The APEX Maven build comes with full support to build a web site using Maven Site.
Use Maven to build the APEX Site.
Stage the APEX web site.
The target folder for the staged site is

- Unix: `/usr/local/src/apex/target/gh-pages`
- Windows: `C:\dev\apex\target\gh-pages`
- Cygwin: `/cygdrive/c/dev/apex/target/gh-pages`

Once the web site is staged, copy the full site to a folder of choice or into a web server.


[IMPORTANT]
.Building a Site takes Time
====
Building and staging the APEX web site can take very long.
The stand-alone documentation will take about 2 minutes.
The sites for all modules and projects and the main APEX site can take between 10-30 minutes depending on your build machine
(~10 minutes without generating source and test-source reports, closer to 30 minutes with all reports).
====


Start the build deleting the staging directory that might have been created by a previous site build.
Then go to the APEX packaging directory.

[source%nowrap,sh]

cd /usr/local/src/apex
rm -fr target/gh-pages

[source%nowrap,bat]

c:
cd \dev\apex
rmdir /s /q target\gh-pages

[source%nowrap,sh]

cd /cygdrive/c/dev/apex
rm -fr target/gh-pages

|====================

the workflow for building a complete site then is as follows:

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
mvn clean -DapexAll #<1>
mvn install -DskipTests #<2>
mvn generate-resources -N -DapexDocs #<3>
mvn initialize site:attach-descriptor site site:stage -DapexSite #<4>
----
. First clean all modules to remove any site artifacts, use the _apexXtext_ profile to make sure these modules are processed as well
. Next run a simple install without tests
. Now generate the APEX stand -alone documentation, they are in the local package only so we can use the _-N_ switch
. Last build the actual sites and stage (copy to the staging directory) with the profile _apexSite_ (do not forget the initialize goal, otherwise the staging directory will not be correctly set and sites are staged in every model in a directory called `docs`).

If you want to build the site for a particular project for testing, the Maven command is simpler.
Since only the main project has APEX documentation (stand-alone), you can use Maven as follow.

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
mvn clean site -DapexSite
----

If you want to stage the tested site, then use

[source%nowrap,sh]
----
mvn clean initialize site:attach-descriptor site site:stage -DapexSite
----
