== Build with all Tests

Use Maven to for a standard build with __all__ tests.

[IMPORTANT]
.Some tests have specific timing Requirements
====
Some of the tests have very specific timing requirements.
If run on a low-powered build machine, or if the build machine is on high load, those tests might fail and the whole build might fail as well.
If this happens, reduce the load on your build machine and restart the build.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Might require specific software
====
When running all tests, some modules require specific software installed on the build machine.
For instance, testing the full capabilities of context (with distribution and persistence) will require Hazelcast and Infinispan installed on the build machine.
