== Concept: ContextItemTemplate

In a __SAMETYPE__ __ContextMap__, the __ContextItemTemplate__ definition provides a template for the __ContextItem__ instances that will be created on the context map at run time.
Each __ContextItem__ concept instance in the context map is created using the __ContextItemTemplate__ template.
It is keyed with a `ReferenceKey` key, which references the context map of the context item.
The __LocalName__ field of the `ReferenceKey`, supplied by the creator of the context item at run time, holds the name of the context item in the context map.
A reference to a __DataType__ concept defines the data type that values of this context item have at run time.
The __WritableFlag__ indicates if the context item is read only or read-write at run time.
