== Concept: Event

An __Event__ defines the structure of a message that passes into or out of an APEX engine or that passes between two states in an APEX engine.
APEX supports message reception and sending in many formats and all messages are translated into an __Event__ prior to processing by an APEX engine.
Event concepts are keyed with an `ArtifactKey` key.
The parameters of an event are held as a map of __EventField__ concept instances with each parameter indexed by the __LocalName__ of its `ReferenceKey`.
An __Event__ has three fields:

* The __NameSpace__ identifies the domain of application of the event
* The __Source__ of the event identifies the system that emitted the event
* The __Target__ of the event identifies the system that the event was sent to

A __PolicyModel__ contains a map of all the events known to a given policy model.
Although an empty model may have no events in its event map, any sane policy model must have at least one __Event__ defined.
