== REST Client IO

APEX can act as REST client on the input as well as on the output interface.
The media type is `application/json`, so this plugin does only work with the JSON Event protocol.

=== REST Client Input

APEX will connect to a given URL to receive events, but not send any events.
The server is polled, i.e. APEX will do an HTTP GET, take the result, and then do the next GET.
Any required timing needs to be handled by the server configured via the URL.
For instance, the server could support a wait timeout via the URL as `?timeout=100ms`.

=== REST Client Output

APEX will connect to a given URL to send events, but not receive any events.
The default HTTP operation is POST (no configuration required).
To change it to PUT simply add the configuration parameter (as shown in the example below).
