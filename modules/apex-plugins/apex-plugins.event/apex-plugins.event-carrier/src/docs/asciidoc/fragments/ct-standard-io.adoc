== Standard IO

Standard IO does not require a specific plugin, it is supported be default.

=== Standard Input

APEX will take events from its standard input.
This carrier is good for testing, but certainly not for a use case where APEX runs as a server.
The configuration is as follows:

----
"carrierTechnologyParameters" : {
  "carrierTechnology" : "FILE", // <1>
  "parameters" : {
    "standardIO" : true <2>
  }
}
----
<1> standard input is considered a file
<2> file descriptor set to standard input


=== Standard Output

APEX will send events to its standard output.
This carrier is good for testing, but certainly not for a use case where APEX runs as a server.
The configuration is as follows:

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"carrierTechnologyParameters" : {
  "carrierTechnology" : "FILE", // <1>
  "parameters" : {
    "standardIO" : true  <2>
  }
}
----
<1> standard output is considered a file
<2> file descriptor set to standard output
