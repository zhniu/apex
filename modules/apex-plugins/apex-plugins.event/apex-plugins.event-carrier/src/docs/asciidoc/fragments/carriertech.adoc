== Carrier Technologies

Carrier technologies define how APEX receives (input) and sends (output) events.
They can be used in any combination, using asynchronous or synchronous mode.
There can also be any number of carrier technologies for the input (consume) and the output (produce) interface.

Supported _input_ technologies are:

- Standard input, read events from the standard input (console), not suitable for APEX background servers
- File input, read events from a file
- Kafka, read events from a Kafka system
- Websockets, read events from a Websocket
- JMS,
- REST (synchronous and asynchronous), additionally as client or server
- Event Requestor, allows reading of events that have been looped back into APEX


Supported _output_ technologies are:

- Standard output, write events to the standard output (console), not suitable for APEX background servers
- File output, write events to a file
- Kafka, write events to a Kafka system
- Websockets, write events to a Websocket
- JMS
- REST (synchronous and asynchronous), additionally as client or server
- Event Requestor, allows events to be looped back into APEX

New carrier technologies can be added as plugins to APEX or developed outside APEX and added to an APEX deployment.
