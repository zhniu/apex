== BCP: Websocket Configuration

The probably best is to configure APEX for Websocket servers for input (ingress, consume) and output (egress, produce) interfaces.
This means that APEX will start Websocket servers on named ports and wait for clients to connect.
Advantage: once APEX is running all connectivity infrastructure is running as well.
Consequence: if APEX is not running, everyone else is in the dark, too.

The best protocol to be used is JSON string.
Each event on any interface is then a string with a JSON encoding.
JSON string is a little bit slower than byte code, but we doubt that this will be noticeable.
A further advantage of JSON strings over Websockets with APEX starting the servers: it is very easy to connect web browsers to such a system.
Simple connect the web browser to the APEX sockets and send/read JSON strings.

Once APEX is started you simply connect Websocket clients to it, and send/receive event.
When APEX is terminated, the Websocket servers go down, and the clients will be disconnected.
APEX does not (yet) support auto-client reconnect nor WAMP, so clients might need to be restarted or reconnected manually after an APEX boot.
