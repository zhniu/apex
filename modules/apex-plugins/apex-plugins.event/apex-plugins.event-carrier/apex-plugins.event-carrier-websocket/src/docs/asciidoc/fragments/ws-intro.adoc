== Websockets

Websocket is a protocol to run sockets of HTTP.
Since it in essence a socket, the connection is realized between a server (waiting for connections) and a client (connecting to a server).
Server/client separation is only important for connection establishment, once connected, everyone can send/receive on the same socket (as any standard socket would allow). 

Standard Websocket implementations are simple, no publish/subscribe and no special event handling.
Most servers simply send all incoming messages to all connections.
There is a PubSub definition on top of Websocket called link:http://wamp-proto.org/[WAMP].
APEX does not support WAMP at the moment.
