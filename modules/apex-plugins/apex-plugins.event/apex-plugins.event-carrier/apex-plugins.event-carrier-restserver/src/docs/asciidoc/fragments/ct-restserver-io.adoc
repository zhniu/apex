== REST Server IO

APEX supports a REST server for input and output.

The REST server plugin always uses a synchronous mode.
A client does a HTTP GET on the APEX REST server with the input event and receives the generated output event in the server reply.
This means that for the REST server there has to always to be an input with an associated output.
Input or output only are not permitted.

The plugin will start a Grizzly server as REST server for a normal APEX engine.
If the APEX engine is executed as a servlet, for instance inside Tomcat, then Tomcat will be used as REST server (this case requires configuration on Tomcat as well).

Some configuration restrictions apply for all scenarios:

- Minimum port: 1024
- Maximum port: 65535
- The media type is `application/json`, so this plugin does only work with the JSON Event protocol.

The URL the client calls is created using

- the configured host and port, e.g. `http://localhost:12345`
- the standard path, e.g. `/apex/`
- the name of the input/output, e.g. `FirstConsumer/`
- the input or output name, e.g. `EventIn`.

The examples above lead to the URL `http://localhost:12345/apex/FirstConsumer/EventIn`.

A client can also get status information of the REST server using `/Status`, e.g. `http://localhost:12345/apex/FirstConsumer/Status`.


=== REST Server Stand-alone

We need to configure a REST server input and a REST server output.
Input and output are associated with each other via there name.

Timeouts for REST calls need to be set carefully.
If they are too short, the call might timeout before a policy finished creating an event.

The following example configures the input named as `MyConsumer` and associates an output named `MyProducer` with it.

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"eventInputParameters": {
  "MyConsumer": {
    "carrierTechnologyParameters" : {
      "carrierTechnology" : "RESTSERVER", <1>
      "parameterClassName" : 
        "com.ericsson.apex.plugins.event.carrier.restserver.RESTServerCarrierTechnologyParameters",
      "parameters" : {
        "standalone" : true, <2>
        "host" : "localhost", <3>
        "port" : 12345 <4>
      }
    },
    "eventProtocolParameters":{
      "eventProtocol" : "JSON" <5>
    },
    "synchronousMode"    : true, <6>
    "synchronousPeer"    : "MyProducer", <7>
    "synchronousTimeout" : 500 <8>
  }
}
----
<1> set REST server as carrier technology
<2> set the server as stand-alone
<3> set the server host
<4> set the server listen port
<5> use JSON event protocol
<6> activate synchronous mode
<7> associate an output `MyProducer`
<8> set a timeout of 500 milliseconds


The following example configures the output named as `MyProducer` and associates the input `MyConsumer` with it.
Note that for the output there are no more paramters (such as host or port), since they are already configured in the associated input

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"eventOutputParameters": {
  "MyProducer": {
    "carrierTechnologyParameters":{
      "carrierTechnology" : "RESTSERVER",
      "parameterClassName" :
        "com.ericsson.apex.plugins.event.carrier.restserver.RESTServerCarrierTechnologyParameters"
    },
    "eventProtocolParameters":{
      "eventProtocol" : "JSON"
    },
    "synchronousMode"    : true,
    "synchronousPeer"    : "MyConsumer",
    "synchronousTimeout" : 500
  }
}
----


=== REST Server Stand-alone, multi input

Any number of input/output pairs for REST servers can be configured.
For instance, we can configure an input `FirstConsumer` with output `FirstProducer` and an input `SecondConsumer` with output `SecondProducer`.
Important is that there is always one pair of input/output.


=== REST Server Stand-alone in Servlet

If APEX is executed as a servlet, e.g. inside Tomcat, the configuration becomes easier since the plugin can now use Tomcat as the REST server.
In this scenario, there are not parameters (port, host, etc.) and the key `standalone` must not be used (or set to false).

For the Tomcat configuration, we need to add the REST server plugin, e.g.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
<servlet>
  ...
  <init-param>
    ...
    <param-value>com.ericsson.apex.plugins.event.carrier.restserver</param-value>
  </init-param>
  ...
</servlet>
