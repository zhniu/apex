== Event Protocols, Format and Encoding

Event protocols define what event formats APEX can receive (input) and should send (output).
They can be used in any combination for input and output, unless further restricted by a carrier technology plugin (for instance for JMS output).
There can only be 1 event protocol per event plugin.

Supported _input_ event protocols are:

- JSON, the event as a JSON string
- APEX, an APEX event
- JMS object, the event as a JMS object,
- JMS text, the event as a JMS text
- XML, the event as an XML string

Supported _output_ event protocols are:

- JSON, the event as a JSON string
- APEX, an APEX event
- JMS object, the event as a JMS object,
- JMS text, the event as a JMS text
- XML, the event as an XML string

New event protocols can be added as plugins to APEX or developed outside APEX and added to an APEX deployment.
