== JSON Event

The event protocol for JSON encoding does not require a specific plugin, it is supported by default.
Furthermore, there is no difference in the configuration for the input and output interface.

For an input, APEX requires a well-formed JSON string.
Well-formed here means according to the definitions of a policy.
Any JSON string that is not defined as a trigger event (consume) will not be consumed (errors will be thrown).
For output JSON events, APEX will always produce valid JSON strings according to the definition in the policy model.

The following JSON shows the configuration.

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"eventProtocolParameters":{
  "eventProtocol" : "JSON"
}
----

For JSON events, there are a few more optional parameters, which allow to define a mapping for standard event fields.
An APEX event must have the fields `name`, `version`, `source`, and `target` defined.
Sometimes it is not possible to configure a trigger or actioning system to use those fields.
However, they might be in an event generated outside APEX (or used outside APEX) just with different names.
To configure APEX to map between the different event names, simply add the following parameters to a JSON event:

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"eventProtocolParameters":{
  "eventProtocol" : "JSON",
  "nameAlias"     : "policyName", <1>
  "versionAlias"  : "policyVersion", <2>
  "sourceAlias"   : "from", <3>
  "targetAlias"   : "to", <4>
  "nameSpaceAlias": "my.name.space" <5>
}
----
<1> mapping for the `name` field, here from a field called `policyName`
<2> mapping for the `version` field, here from a field called `policyVersion`
<3> mapping for the `source` field, here from a field called `from` (only for an input event)
<4> mapping for the `target` field, here from a field called `to` (only for an output event)
<5> mapping for the `nameSpace` field, here from a field called `my.name.space`
