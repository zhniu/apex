== JMS Event

The event protocol for JMS is provided by the APEX JMS plugin.
The plugin supports encoding as JSON text or as object.
There is no difference in the configuration for the input and output interface.

=== JMS Text

If used as input, APEX will take a JMS message and extract a JSON string, then proceed as if a JSON event was received.
If used as output, APEX will take the event produced by a policy, create a JSON string, and then wrap it into a JMS message.

The configuration for JMS text is as follows:

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"eventProtocolParameters":{
  "eventProtocol" : "JMSTEXT",
  "parameterClassName" :
    "com.ericsson.apex.plugins.event.protocol.jms.JMSTextEventProtocolParameters"
}
----


=== JMS Object

If used as input, APEX will will take a JMS message, extract a Java Bean from the `ObjectMessage` message, construct an APEX event and put the bean on the APEX event as a parameter.
If used as output, APEX will take the event produced by a policy, create a Java Bean and send it as a JMS message.

The configuration for JMS object is as follows:

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"eventProtocolParameters":{
  "eventProtocol" : "JMSOBJECT",
  "parameterClassName" :
    "com.ericsson.apex.plugins.event.protocol.jms.JMSObjectEventProtocolParameters"
}
