== XML Event

The event protocol for XML is provided by the APEX XML plugin.
There is no difference in the configuration for the input and output interface.

If used as input, APEX will consume events as XML and map them to policy trigger events.
Not well-formed XML and not understood trigger events will be rejected.
If used as output, APEX produce XML encoded events from the event a policy produces.
Those events will always be well-formed according to the definition in the policy model.

The following code shows the configuration.
