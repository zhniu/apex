== Configure AVRO Schema Handler

The AVRO schema handler is added to the configuration as follows:

[source%nowrap,json]
----
"engineServiceParameters":{
  "engineParameters":{
    "contextParameters":{
      "parameterClassName" : "com.ericsson.apex.context.parameters.ContextParameters",
      "schemaParameters":{
        "Avro":{
          "parameterClassName" : 
            "com.ericsson.apex.plugins.context.schema.avro.AvroSchemaHelperParameters"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Using the AVRO schema handler has one limitation: AVRO only supports field names that represent valid Java class names.
This means only letters and the character `_` are supported.
Characters commonly used in field names, such as `.` and `-`, are not supported by AVRO.
for more information see link:https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.1/spec.html#names[Avro Spec: Names].

To work with this limitation, the APEX Avro plugin will parse a given AVRO definition and replace _all_ occurrences of `.` and `-` with a `_`.
This means that

- In a policy model, if the AVRO schema defined a field as `my-name` the policy logic should access it as `my_name`
- In a policy model, if the AVRO schema defined a field as `my.name` the policy logic should access it as `my_name`
- There should be no field names that convert to the same internal name
  ** For instance the simultaneous use of `my_name`, `my.name`, and `my-name` should be avoided
  ** If not avoided, the event processing might create unwanted side effects
- If field names use any other not-supported character, the AVRO plugin will reject it
  ** Since AVRO uses lazy initialization, this rejection might only become visible at runtime
