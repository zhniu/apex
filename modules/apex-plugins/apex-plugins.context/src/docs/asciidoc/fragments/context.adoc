== Context Handlers

Context handlers are responsible for all context processing.
There are the following main areas:

- Context schema: use schema handlers other than Java class (supported by default without configuration)
- Context distribution: distribute context across multiple APEX engines
- Context locking: mechanisms to lock context elements for read/write
- Context persistence: mechanisms to persist context

APEX provides plugins for each of the main areas.
