== Executors

Executors are plugins that realize the execution of logic contained in a policy model.
Logic can be in a task selector, a task, and a state finalizer.
Using plugins for execution environments makes APEX very flexible to support virtually any executable logic expressions.

APEX {release-version} supports the following executors:

- Java, for Java implemented logic
  ** This executor requires logic implemented using the APEX Java interfaces.
  ** Generated JAR files must be in the classpath of the APEX engine at start time.
- Javascript
- JRuby,
- Jython,
- MVEL
  ** This executor uses the latest version of the MVEL engine, which can be very hard to debug and can produce unwanted side effects during execution
