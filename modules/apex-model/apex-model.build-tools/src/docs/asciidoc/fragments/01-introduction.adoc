== Introduction: APEX Codestyle

This page describes how to apply a code style to the APEX Java projects.
The provided code templates are guidelines and are provided for references and as examples.
We will not engage in "holy war" on style for coding.
As long as the style of a particular block of code is understandable, consistent, and readable, please feel free to adapt or modify these guides or use other guides as you see fit.

The JAutoDoc and Checkstyle Eclipse Plugins and tools are useful and remove a lot of the tedium from code documentation.
Use them to check your code and please fix any issues they identify with your code.

The templates and examples on this page have been tested on a clean installation of Eclipse Oxygen Release (4.7.0) on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS.

The Apex settings referred to on this page are also available in the apex-model GIT repository in the APEX model repository in apex-model/apex-model.build-tools/src/main/resources/`.
