== Configure Checkstyle Blueprint

As well as being configured globally, Checkstyle must be configured and activated for each project in Eclipse.
In order to make this process less tedious, set up the first project you apply Checkstye to as a blueprint project and then use this blueprint for all other projects.

. Select the project you want to use as a blueprint
  * For example, `apex-model.basic-model` in `apex` and enter the project properties by right clicking and selecting menu:Properties[]
. Click __Checkstyle__ on the properties to get the Checkstyle project configuration window
. Click the box __Checkstyle active for this project__ and in the __Exclude from checking...__ list check the boxes:
  * [*] __files outside source directories__
  * [*] __derived (generated) files__
  * [*] __files from packages:__
. Now, in order to turn off checking on resource directories and on JUnit tests
  * Select the line __files from packages:__ in the __Exclude from checking...__ list and click kbd:[Change...]
. On the __Filter packages__ dialogue
  * Check all the boxes except the top box, which is the box for __src/main/java__
  * Ensure that the __recursively exclude sub-packages__ check box is ticked
    ** [*] __recursively exclude sub-packages__
  * Press kbd:[OK]
. Press kbd:[Apply and Close] to apply the changes
