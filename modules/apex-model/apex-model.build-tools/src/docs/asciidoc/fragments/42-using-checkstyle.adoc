== Using Checkstyle

In order to use Checkstyle, you must configure it per project and then activate it per project.
The easiest way to do this is to set up one project as a blueprint and use that blueprint for other projects (see above).
Once you have a blueprint project, you can use Checkstyle on other projects as follows

. Set up Checkstyle on projects by selecting one or more projects
  * Right clicking and selecting menu:Checkstyle[Configure project(s)] from __blueprint...__ and then selecting your blueprint project
  * (for example `apex-model.basic-model`) from the list of projects and pressing kbd:[OK]
. Activate Checkstyle on projects by selecting one or more projects
  * Right clicking and selecting menu:Checkstyle[Activate Checkstyle]
  * Now Checkstyle warnings will appear on the selected projects if they have warnings
. You can disable Checkstyle checking on a file or a package (recursively) by selecting a file or package
  * Right clicking and selecting menu:Checkstyle[Clear Checkstyle violations]
. You can enable Checkstyle checking on a file or a package (recursively) by selecting a file or package
  * Right clicking and selecting menu:Checkstyle[Check Code with Checkstyle]
. On individual files, you can apply fixes that clear some Checkstyle warnings
  * Select the file, right click and select menu:Apply Checkstyle fixes[]
