This module contains several demos for Policy-controlled Video Streaming (PCVS).
Each demo defines a policy using AVRO and Javascript (or other scripting languages for the policy logic).
To run the demo, a vanilla Ubuntu server with some extra software packages is required:

* Mininet as network simulator
* Floodlight as SDN controller
* Kafka as messaging system
* Zookeeper for Kafka configuration
* APEX for policy control
