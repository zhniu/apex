== Logic: Policy Establish State

This is the logic for the establish state.
It is the most complicated logic, since establishing a situation for a decision is the most important part of any policy.
First, the policy describes what we find (the switch block), in terms of 8 normal situations and 1 extreme error case.

If required, it creates local context information for the problem (if it is new) or updates it (if the problem still exists).
It also calculates customer SLA downtime and checks for any SLA violations.
Finally, it creates a situation object.
