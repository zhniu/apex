== Simple Websocket Clients

In a full installation, the APEX applications provide two demo Websocket clients: echo and console.
The __echo__ client connects to a Websocket server and prints all events it receives (reading text/string from Websocket).
The __console__ client connects to a Websocket server, takes strings from the console (multi-line JSON encoded string starting with ‘{‘ and ending with ‘}’) and sends them as text via a Websocket.

Both demo clients use `Java-WebSocket` and have no further dependency on APEX:
