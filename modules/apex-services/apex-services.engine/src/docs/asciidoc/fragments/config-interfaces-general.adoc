== Input and Output Interfaces

An APEX engine has two main interfaces:

- An _input_ interface to receive events: also known as ingress interface or consumer, receiving (consuming) events commonly named triggers, and
- An _output_ interface to publish produced events: also known as egress interface or producer, sending (publishing) events commonly named actions or action events.

The input and output interface is configured in terms of inputs and outputs, respectively.
Each input and output is a combination of a carrier technology and an event protocol.
Carrier technologies and event protocols are provided by plugins, each with its own specific configuration.
Most carrier technologies can be configured for input as well as output.
Most event protocols can be used for all carrier technologies.
One exception is the JMS object event protocol, which can only be used for the JMS carrier technology.
Some further restrictions apply (for instance for carrier technologies using bi- or uni-directional modes).

Input and output interface can be configured separately, in isolation, with any number of carrier technologies.
The resulting general configuration options are:

- Input interface with one or more inputs
  ** each input with a carrier technology and an event protocol
  ** some inputs with optional synchronous mode
  ** some event protocols with additional parameters
- Output interface with one or more outputs
  ** each output with a carrier technology and an event encoding
  ** some outputs with optional synchronous mode
  ** some event protocols with additional parameters

The configuration for input and output is contained in `eventInputParameters` and `eventOutputParameters`, respectively.
Inside here, one can configure any number of inputs and outputs.
Each of them needs to have a unique identifier (name), the content of the name is free form.
The example below shows a configuration for two inputs and two outputs.

=== Event Filters

APEX will always send an event after a policy execution is finished.
For a successful execution, the event sent is the output event created by the policy.
In case the policy does not create an output event, APEX will create a new event with all input event fields plus an additional field `exceptionMessage` with an exception message.

There are situations in which this auto-generated error event might not be required or wanted:

* when a policy failing should not result in an event send out via an output interface
* when the auto-generated event goes back in an APEX engine (or the same APEX engine), this can create endless loops
* the auto-generated event should go to a special output interface or channel

All of these situations are supported by a filter option using a wildecard (regular expression) configuration on APEX I/O interfaces.
The parameter is called `eventNameFilter` and the value are link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java regular expressions] (a link:http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html[tutorial]).
