== Quick Guide: How to build APEX from source


[IMPORTANT]
.A Build needs Space
====
Building APEX requires approximately 2-3 GB of hard disc space, 1 GB for the actual build with full distribution and 1-2 GB for the downloaded dependencies
====

[IMPORTANT]
.A Build requires Internet (for first build)
====
During the build, several (a lot) of Maven dependencies will be downloaded and stored in the configured local Maven repository.
The first standard build (and any first specific build) requires Internet access to download those dependencies.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Building RPM distributions
====
RPM images are only build if the `rpm` package is installed (Unix).
To install `rpm` run `sudo apt-get install rpm`, then build APEX.
====



=== Standard build

Without tests, takes about 5 minutes

----
mvn install -DskipTests
----

With standard tests, takes about 10-15 minutes

----
mvn install
----

With all tests (requires some database and other software installed)

----
mvn install -DapexAll
----


=== Building the HowTo with all details


Build the APEX stand-alone documentation

----
mvn generate-resources -N -DapexDocs
----

Then open the HowTo in a browser, for example

----
firefox target/generated-docs/html/HowTo-Build-APEX.html
----


=== APEX Site

Building a complete site workflow (start with cleaning your local site staging directory).

[IMPORTANT]
.Building a Site takes Time
====
Building and staging the APEX web site can take very long.
The stand-alone documentation will take about 2 minutes.
The sites for all modules and projects and the main APEX site can take between 10-30 minutes depending on your build machine
(~10 minutes without generating source and test-source reports, closer to 30 minutes with all reports).
====


----
mvn clean -DapexAll
mvn install -DskipTests
mvn generate-resources -N -DapexDocs
mvn initialize site:attach-descriptor site site:stage -DapexSite
